# Stardew Valley Min-Max Routing / Strategy

* This is a "min-max" guide for a Stardew Valley run created by [BlackSight6](https://old.reddit.com/user/BlackSight6) & [Zamiell](https://www.twitch.tv/Zamiell).
* This route / strategy is designed for experienced Stardew players; knowledge of many game mechanics is assumed. While the guide is fairly in-depth, obvious things will not be explained.
* We assume some restrictions/rules, which makes this different from other min-max guides out there.
* Many guides out there are designed for older versions of the game. This guide is designed for [version 1.4.5](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Version_History). (In this version, explosive ammo is nerfed, the mushroom floor is nerfed, and so forth.)

## Preface

Before we start with the route, let's first go over some high-level things that you need to know over the course of the run.

### Goal

The general goal of this route is to maximize the total amount of money gained by the end of the first season. This leaves you in a good position to accomplish whatever goals that you want, whether it be to continue to min-max money, or to 100% your save file (e.g. max friendship with every villager, etc.).

### Route Overview

* This route starts off by doing a ton of fishing, unlocking the Skull Caverns as soon as possible. One the Skull Caverns are opened, you craft and sell Iridium Bars to make a lot of money.
  * Routes that involve fishing + Skull Caverns are overall more profitable than the typical naieve strategy of planting Strawberries.
* With the money, you buy a lot of Starfruit + Deluxe Speed Grow, with the goal to get three Starfruit harvests during Summer (and with all of the crops being automatically watered by Quality Sprinklers).

### Rules

The guide is generally designed for players who are playing on the vanilla game (no mods), not using [Stardew Predictor](https://mouseypounds.github.io/stardew-predictor/), not using the [item spawning cheat](https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/Cheats_and_Secrets), and so forth. Of course, you are welcome to play the game in any way you see fit, but the authors challenge you to try to do a run that uses as little grey-area strategies as possible in order to increase the challenge as much as possible. For a full list of self-imposed restrictions that we recommend, see [Appendix A]().

### Gold per Energy List (GPE)

In general, you should always eat items with the [lowest gold to energy ratio](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Zamiel/Gold_to_Energy_Ratios). For this route, you can use the following simple rule:

* save everything with a ratio equal to or less than 2 for eating
* sell everything with a ratio above 2

### Energy Recovery Mechanics

* On the day after a player has gained one or more skill level increases, they will always start with full energy, even if they passed out on the previous day. They will also still start with full energy even if they were below 0 energy and had the "exhausted" icon showing above the energy bar.
  * Note that with this route, players will gain one or more skill level increases on every single day until Spring 12.
* When a player passes out at 2 AM, 10% of their gold is taken (maxing out at 1000g). However, if the player has no gold in their inventory, they will incur no penalty. Or, if they have a very small amount of gold, the resulting gold loss will be completely trivial (e.g. losing 5g with a bank of 50g).
* When a player falls asleep at midnight or earlier, they will regenerate 100% of their energy. When a player falls asleep after 12 AM, they will regenerate a variable percentage of energy depending on how late it was. For example, at 1 AM, they will regenerate 75% of their energy, and at 2 AM, they will regenerate 50% of their energy.
* Thus, we can combine the above three mechanics to stay up to 2 AM on almost every single day with no consequences.

### General Fishing Strategy

* When the fish is flying towards you at the end of the mini-game, you can hold down the mouse button in order to skip the graphic that displays what fish is caught and immediately re-cast. (This is optimal because time passes when this graphic is showing.)
* In spring, the best fishing spot for non-rainy days is the mountain lake.
  * Not only does it have the highest best gold per hour ratio, it also has the easiest difficulty fish. Perfect catches are the best way to level up the fishing skill.
* In spring, the best fishing spot for rainy days is the forest river.
  * This is because Catfish sell for a lot of gold. They are difficult to catch with low fishing skill, but you should still be able to catch around 50% of them.
* Prioritize eating [Green Algae](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Green_Algae) (1.15 ratio), then [Joja Cola](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Joja_Cola) (1.92 ratio), then the highest-quality [Chub](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Chub).
* Prioritize capturing fishing chests over perfect fish. (The rewards can be extremely good.)
* Make sure that you keep 4 or 5 inventory slots free by occasionally moving fish from your inventory into the chest. (This is because you can catch 1 new fish + get up to 4 items from a fishing chest.)
* When casting at 7 energy or below, you will correctly drop into the appropriate amount of negative energy, even though the energy meter will appear to be at 0. For example, when casting at 2 energy, you will go to -6 energy. And then, after eating a Green Algae to restore 13 energy, you will go back to positive 7 energy. Thus, it is mostly irrelevant whether or not you accidentally slip past 0 energy while fishing (at least as long as you get a level up before the next day to remove the exhaustion).
* Be on the lookout for bubbles. If you see them, is generally better to try to cast in them, even if you will not be doing maximum casts. (The increased catch-rate is more important than the slight increase in type of fish & quality of fish.)
* In summer, the most profitable spot to fish is at the ocean, regardless of the weather.

### General Mines Strategy

* Starting on Spring 11, the goal is to go as deep in the mines as possible. As soon as you discover the staircase on a floor, immediately enter it. Do **not** go out of your way to explore the rest of the floor, do **not** kill any additional enemies, do **not** stop to mine any visible metal nodes, do **not** stop to mine any visible gem nodes, etc. (You will be able to easily farm metal later on.)
* Every time you get to a new elevator floor, return to the 0th floor and empty your inventory in the chest + restock furnaces, if any. If you are at level 2 mining or above, remember to keep the stone on you (so that you can craft a [Staircase](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Staircase) on an infested floor).
* On the early floors, skip over mining the gray rocks in favor of the other color rocks. (This is because it takes two hits to destroy a gray rock and one hit to destroy the other ones.)
  * When you have a copper pickaxe or better, this strategy no longer applies, as gray rocks will be destroyed in 1 hit.
  * One alternate strategy would be to intentionally kill all the gray rocks first, because they grant 3 mining XP (as opposed to the 0 XP from normal rocks). This allows the ability to craft Staircases on the second day of mining (as opposed to only getting the ability on the 3rd day of mining). While this is useful for bypassing infested floors, the strategy will only pay off if you happen to get an infested floor on the 2nd day of mining. Thus, I do not believe that this strategy is worth it.
* If the floor is small, search it for an existing staircase before starting to kill enemies or mine rocks. (Do not bother to do this if the floor is medium/large, as it will be a huge waste of time.)
* If the floor is small and you can see that there are 3 or less total enemies, kill all the the enemies first. This will increase your chance of spawning a staircase from a rock by 4%.
* If there are 4 or more enemies on the floor, avoid all the enemies (if possible) and **only** mine rocks. The exception is if it is a "somewhat annoyed" or "very displeased" luck day; the 4% chance increase can help a lot in this case.
* If you get lucky enough to randomly get a club weapon drop, you can use it to deal massive amounts of damage by right clicking and then spam left clicking. (This is referred to as the "club spam" strategy.) For this reason, it usually always better to use a club over a sword or dagger.
* If you plan to pass out at the mines and you know that you know that you cannot reach the next elevator by 2 AM, then give up and farm copper/iron/gold until 2 AM (depending on what you need).
  * The best way to farm copper ore is by doing floor 21 over and over.
  * The best way to farm iron ore is by doing floor 41 over and over.
  * The best way to farm gold ore is by doing floor 81 over and over.
* When you get to floor 100, don't immediately take the Stardrop. Save it for when you are completely out of energy. (It restores all of your energy in addition to increasing the maximum amount of energy.)

### General Skull Caverns Strategy

* When you first go to the desert, you will need to use the bus. Pam exits her house at 8:40 AM. Stand in front of her door to block her and it will force her into a state where she will start running. Do the same trick again once Pam enters the Bus Stop screen. Combined, this makes Pam get to the bus at 9:36 AM instead of at 10:09 AM (saving 33 minutes).
* Trade all [Rubies](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Ruby) to the [Desert Trader](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Desert_Trader) for [Spicy Eel](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Desert_Trader). Use one immediately for the speed boost and keep it going for the whole day.
* Trade all [Diamonds](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Diamond) to the [Desert Trader](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Desert_Trader) for [Triple Shot Espresso](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Triple_Shot_Espresso). Use one immediately for the speed boost and keep it going for the whole day.
* Trade all [Omni Geodes](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Omni_Geode) to the [Desert Trader](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Desert_Trader) for [Warp Totem: Desert](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Warp_Totem:_Desert). Use these to get to the desert on subsequent days.
* In general, ignore all enemies and focus on breaking rocks. (This is the same general strategy as the mines.) It is hard to avoid [Serpents](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Serpent) though, so you will have to kill some of them.
* The initial goal will be to get a [Prismatic Shard](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Prismatic_Shard) for the [Galaxy Sword](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Galaxy_Sword).
* You can craft some bombs for big clusters of rocks/ore, but do not go overboard, as you need to build up some ore for Quality Sprinklers.
* You will be tempted to get an [Iridium Pickaxe](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Pickaxes) as soon as possible, but you should hold off until summer. This is because you will be fishing on the day that Clint works on the pickaxe, and fishing in summer is much more profitable tham fishing in spring.
* Smelt all [Iridium Ore](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Iridium_Ore) into [Iridium Bars](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Iridium_Bar). Besides selling various gems, the bars will be the main source of revenue from the Skull Cavern. However, wait until you have the Blacksmith profession (from level 10 mining) before selling any Iridium Bars.
* When you start doing the Skull Cavern, you will only have the first backpack upgrade. You will want to buy the 2nd backpack upgrade (10,000g) as soon as possible. (On average, you should be able to afford it after the first two Skull Cavern runs.)

### Weather Modifications

* Rain will occur randomly on different days, depending on the RNG seed of your particular save file.
* Starting on Spring 4, you should be checking the TV every morning to see what the weather will be on the next day. This is because you will need to change the route on the fly depending on the weather. (And you need to know ahead of time in order to shuffle chest contents & furnaces.)
* On a rainy day, you should disregard everything that the guide says and spend as much as possible fishing at the forest river. This is because Catfish sell for so much money that everything else becomes less important.
* Getting money is important because the main goal of the route is to finish the vault as soon as possible (42,500g).
  * If it is raining and you have already completed the vault, then it is usually better to do Skull Cavern runs than to fish.
* For reference, you can get about 10,000g per day when fishing at the forest river when it rains (at level 10).

### Pet Mechanics

* If you are not doing a Grandpa-points-related challenge, then it is optimal to not have a pet at all, as they get in your way and make you lose time.
* If you are doing a Grandpa-points-related challenge, then you may need to get the pet for the Grandpa points. In this case, it is optimal to choose a cat over a dog, since they sleep in your bed and you can easily pet them when going to bed at the end of the day.
* Note that it only takes 83 pets in order to maximize the pet's friendship value. Thus, since pet friendship does not decay, you may be able to defer wasting any time petting the pet until summer of year 2. (It is optimal to wait as long as possible to start petting since "spare time" is extremely limited at the beginning of the game.)
* Subsequently, because of the petting mechanic, you should **never** have to fill up the pet's bowl. (Unless for whatever reason you deferred petting for too long and need to get extra friendship before the deadline.)

### Other Notes

* If your character's gender does not matter to you, then it is optimal to choose a female, as they get 500g in the mail instead of a [Cookie](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Cookie).
* Always set the game options to zoom out as far as possible (e.g. 75%). This makes you waste less time while foraging & mining.
* For reference, it is possible to get up to 22 Spring Onions on Spring 1. (It is not required to get any Spring Onions on Spring 1, but it certainly helps.)
* Do not read any of your mail unless explicitly told to by the guide.
  * This is because at many points in the run, you need to stay at 0 gold for the purposes of staying out late. Since some letters contain gold, you want to only check the mail at specific points.
* Choose Mushrooms over Bats for the Cave. This is for several reasons:
  * The cave restocks faster, granting more total items.
  * On average, mushrooms sell for more than fruit.
  * Common Mushrooms are a good energy food. They have high GPE and you can build up a large stack of them.
* You will find some [Rice Shoots](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Rice_Shoot) from fishing chests during the first half of spring. While not mentioned explicitly in the route, all Rice Shoots should be planted next to water no later than Spring 21.
  * Spending the time to hoe and plant them is worth it because each Rice Shoot grants 7 farming XP. This in turn allows you to save gold & time via buying less Kale on Spring 11 and Spring 21.

## The Route

### Spring 1

The plan for the day is to meet everybody in the town and save money for tomorrow so that we can buy the [Fiberglass Rod](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Fiberglass_Rod) for 1,800g as soon as possible. (We want to meet everybody so that we can complete the "Introductions" quest in order to unlock the "How to Win Friends" for an extra 100g on Spring 2.)

An alternate strategy for Spring 1 would be to ignore all of the villagers and focus on killing every weed on the map + every weed on the farm, which has the advantage of getting a few more mixed seeds planted on the first day. However, in the "meet everybody" route, you still kill plenty of weeds, making the overall number of mixed seeds very similiar. Thus, the marginal number of mixed seeds gathered in the alternate route is not worth more than the early 100g.

* Take the Parsnip Seeds.
* Immediately chop down trees until foraging level 1. We want to get level 1 before we leave to go foraging so that we have a chance to get silver-quality Spring Onions and such. (Focus on **only** chopping down trees. The route is very tight.)
  * Only chop down Maple and Pine trees, not Oak trees. (We won't get any acorns for felling an Oak tree until Spring 2 and acorns are precious.)
  * For the same reason, do not axe/hoe any seeds in the ground until Spring 2, or they will be destroyed.
  * Do not chop the stumps; only chop a tree until it falls, then move on to the next one. (It yields more wood and more foraging XP to do it this way.)
  * Do not chop wood tiles until you are already at foraging level 1 (as they don't provide any foraging XP).
  * As soon as a tree starts to fall, walk towards where the wood will spawn and immediately pause the game. This prevents in-game time from passing, but the tree falling animation will still complete. Additionally, all of the wood will automatically be collected by the player while the game is still paused. (You should use this strategy whenever you are chopping trees and not bothering to kill the stumps.)
* Once foraging level 1, craft a chest, place it next to the house, and empty all inventory except for scythe + axe + pickaxe + hoe.
* Exit south to the forest. (The time should be around 9:20 AM.)
* Head left past the Traveling Cart area, down to the Abandoned House, right to the Spring Onion area, and up to Marnie's Ranch.
  * Pick up all foragables along the way.
  * Try to kill as many weeds as possible, but do not go too far out of your way for just 1 weed (since you need to make it to Jas at 11:20 AM).
* Meet Jas as she exits her house around 11:20 AM.
* Meet Haley as she walks towards Leah's house.
* Go to town.
* Check the two garbage cans next to Jodi's house + Haley's house.
* Meet Emily inside of her house.
* Meet Marnie outside of Pierre's General Store.
* Meet Penny to the left of the graveyard.
* Go to the beach.
* Leave any beach foraging items on the ground. (We do not have the inventory space right now and we can just collect them on Spring 2.)
* Meet Elliott outside of his cabin.
* Check for + hoe artifact spots.
* Go to town.
* If you got an artifact, donate it to the museum and claim the reward (250g).
* Check the garbage cans next to the museum + blacksmith.
* Meet Clint inside of the blacksmith. (When leaving the blacksmith, go to the right side.)
* Check the garbage can next to JojaMart.
* Meet Pam + Sam + Shane inside of JojaMart. (Even though Sam & Shane are working, it still counts as meeting them.)
* Clear the weeds north-west of JojaMart.
* Meet Abigale on the bridge.
* Meet Maru. (She is walking south to the benches.)
* Check the garbage can next to Lewis' house.
* Meet Evelyn + Caroline + Jodi + Vincent + Harvey west of Lewis' house.
* Kill the weeds along the left side of the map by Harvey.
* Meet Leah + Pierre inside of Pierre's General Store. (You have to go behind the counter to talk to Pierre.)
* Check the garbage can next to the Saloon.
* Meet Gus in the Saloon. (You have to go behind the counter to talk to him.)
* Check the garbage can next to George's house.
* Meet George + Alex inside of their house. (Alex finishes his workout and leaves his room at 4 PM. If you are fast, you might need to wait here for a few minutes.)
* Go back to the farm. (Leave all of the foragables at the Bus Stop on the ground for now.)
* Empty your inventory. Keep the tools.
* Clear a path to the Backwoods. Exit to the Backwoods around 6:10 PM.
* Meet Linus outside of his tent.
* Meet Demetrius south-east of his house. (You do not need to talk to Robin because you already met her.)
* Meet Sebastian as he leaves his house. (If you got here before 7 PM, then you will have to idle until he comes out of his room at 6:40 PM. This is wasted time that you could have used to kill more weeds elsewhere.)
* Go south to the community center.
* Kill the weeds to the left of the community center.
* Kill the weeds to the left of the fountain.
* Go home. (Get any foragables at the Bus Stop that you missed earlier.)
* Hoe + plant + water Parsnip Seeds + Mixed Seeds.
* Eat all Spring Onions. (They are near-worthless to sell.)
* Chop wood until around 4-6 energy left.
* Kill weeds + grass until around 1:30 AM.
* Sell all but 20 fiber, all sap, all clay + all pinecones + extra spring foraging items + any food from the garbage cans (except for [Field Snack](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Field_Snack)).
  * In other words, keep stone + wood + coal + 20 fiber + 1 of each spring foragable.
  * Normally, we would save Leeks, Dandelions, and food from the garbage cans to eat, since they have a low GPE. However, we need as much money as possible for Spring 2, so we need to sell them today as an exception to the rule.
* Hoe + plant + water any remaining mixed seeds.
  * Note that you can work past 0 energy and become exhausted with no penalty carrying over to Spring 2 (because you will level up foraging).
* Go to bed at 2 AM. (We do not want to incur the gold penalty.)
* At the end of the day, you should get:
  * Foraging 0 --> 1

### Spring 2

* Move the TV next to the bed (so that later on you can immediately check it upon waking up). I also like to delete the carpet so that it does not get in the way, but that is optional.
  * You need to do this on Spring 1 or Spring 2, because you will have a full inventory on subsequent days.
* Read all of the mail. (We need to read Willy's letter in order to be given the [Bamboo Pole](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bamboo_Pole).)
* Water.
* Craft a chest and take it with you.
  * If you got 0 to 3 Spring Onions on Spring 1 (and did not get any food from garbage cans), then you may not have had enough energy to chop 50 wood on Spring 1. Chop 50 wood now and continue following the route; note that you will be a little bit behind on everything.
* Empty all inventory in the chest. Retrieve the hoe + crafted chest + 1 rock.
* Check the garbage cans next to the George's house + next to the Saloon + next to Lewis' house. (If you are seen, it does not matter, since you friendship with each villager is essentially still at 0.)
* Go to the beach and get the Bamboo Pole.
* Give the rock to Willy and claim the reward for the "How To Win Friends" quest (100g).
* Place the chest on the bottom-right hand corner of the pier.
* Fish facing right from the pier. Use minimum casts.
  * This gives a greater probability to catch easier fish and also saves time on casting/reeling animations.
  * Also see [General Fishing Strategy](#general-fishing-strategy).
* At 8:40 AM, destroy the Bamboo Pole and check the rest of the beach for any foragables + artifact spots.
  * If you get an artifact now and did not get one on Spring 1, then immediately go turn it in and claim the reward (250g).
* Go to Willy's shop. Sell all beach foragables + fish. Buy the [Training Rod](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Training_Rod) from Willy for 25g.
  * The Training Rod will allow more perfect catches. (Leveling up the fishing skill with perfect catches is more important than getting higher-quality fish.)
* Fish until you have enough fish to sell to get up to 1,800g. (Continue using minimum casts.)
* If out of Seaweed and Joja Cola, eat the highest quality Anchovy or Herring.
* When you have enough fish to sell to get up to 1800g, destroy the Training Rod, sell all the fish, and buy the [Fiberglass Rod](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Fiberglass_Rod) from Willy. Also, buy as much [Bait](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bait_(item)) as possible (5g each) and equip it on the new rod.
  * Even though we will have less perfect catches, the Fiberglass Rod will allow us to gain experience faster because of the bait.
* Fish using max casts at the same spot as before.
* At 4:30 PM, if you do not have at least 35 bait on the rod, go to Willy and buy more. (You need enough bait to last for the rest of the day + tomorrow morning.)
* Fish until 2 AM. Before passing out, leave all of the fish in the chest. (We will sell them to Willy tomorrow.)
* At the end of the day, you should get:
  * Fishing 0 --> 4

### Spring 3

* It always rains on Spring 3.
* Empty all inventory in the chest. Retrieve the Fiberglass Rod + hoe.
* Check the same 3 garbage cans as yesterday.
* Check the beach for foragables + artifact spots.
* Fish until 9 AM.
* At Willy's shop, sell all fish + any extra beach foraging items. Buy bait until you only have 75g left. (However, if you already found a copper ore from a fishing chest, you can spend all money on bait.)
  * Technically, we could defer selling some fish until we have the Fisher profession. However, this has three problems. First, it is only worth it if you would gain more money than around an hour of fishing at the mountain lake. Second, you can only bring so many fish back with you when you pass out at the end of Spring 3. Third, the next convienent place to buy bait is on Spring 5 after turning in the pickaxe, and there is almost no spare time on this day. Thus, it is overall simpler and much less risky to sell the fish now.
* Empty the contents of the chest and pick it up. (To pick up a chest without a pickaxe, select an empty square on the toolbar and spam left-click.)
* If you saved 75g, go to Clint and buy a copper ore (75g) in order to initiate the Clint cutscene tomorrow. (You do not have to drop the copper on the ground.)
* Go to the forest river. The best spot to fish is casting downwards 6 tiles to the left of Leah's door. Place the chest one tile above and to the right of you.
  * For reference, see [the pathing infographic](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/4/44/Pathing-Forest.jpg) on the wiki.
* Fish until 2 AM. Before passing out, fill your inventory with the rod + gems + ore + coal + the most expensive fish.
  * You will not return to this chest until Spring 7 (or the next rainy day, whichever is sooner).
* At the end of the day, you should get:
  * Fishing 4 --> 6 (choose Fisher profession)

### Spring 4

* From here on out, check the TV every single day to reveal the next day's weather so that you can plan accordingly. (For example, if you are fishing at the mountain lake and you know that it will not rain on the next day, you can safely leave your fishing pole in the chest at the end of the day.)
* Water.
* If you do not have 150 wood, chop up to 150 wood. (Remember to take your Scythe while chopping to clear grass.)
  * This is because we will need 2 more chests and a scarecrow over the next 2 days.
* Craft a Chest and take it with you.
* Empty your inventory. Retrieve the Fiberglass Rod + crafted chest.
* Go to the mountain lake. The best spot to fish is casting rightwards while standing next to the fence at the bottom of the screen. Place the chest three tiles behind you.
  * For reference, see [the pathing infographic](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/e/e2/Pathing-Mountain.jpg) on the wiki.
* Fish until 1:00 AM. Fill your inventory with any gems, ore, coal, and the most expensive fish.
  * You can leave your Fiberglass Rod in the chest unless it is going to rain tomorrow.
* Go home. 
* Ship gems + fish.
  * Save any [Chubs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Chub) for eating.
  * Save one of each fish that is used in community center bundles.
  * Save [Rubies](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Ruby) and [Diamonds](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Diamond) for the Skull Cavern later on.
* It should be 2 AM immediately after selling. If not, cut down grass and pass out.
* At the end of the day, you should get:
  * Fishing 6 --> 7

### Spring 5

The main goal for this day is to make 5 copper bars as soon as possible and then make it to Clint before he closes to upgrade the pickaxe. (The window to do this is small.) Then, we plant some seeds. Then, we fish.

* From here on out, check the TV every single day to reveal the current day's luck.
* Choose to either take the pet or decline it. (See [Pet Mechanics](#pet-mechanics).)
* Harvest the Parsnips and make a note of how many you harvested.
* Make a note of which mixed seeds you have planted. (You can tell either by looking at the appearance of the seed or by using [a mod](https://github.com/Zamiell/stardew-valley/blob/master/Min-Max_Guide.md#ui-info-suite).)
* Claim the reward for the parsnip quest (100g).
* Do not water any remaining mixed seeds until later on in the day.
* Craft a chest and take it with you. 
* Make a note of how many iron ore and gold ore you have, if any. (They randomly drop from fishing chests.)
* Retrieve the pickaxe + gems + stone + coal + copper + all but 3 parsnips from the chest.
  * Leave Rubies and Diamonds though since we want to save those for the Skull Caverns.
  * We need 1 parsnip for the bundle, 1 parsnip to ship (optional), and 1 parsnip for Pam (optional).
* Go to the mines.
* Place the chest to the left of the elevator.
* Make your way to floor 10. (See [General Mines Strategy](#general-mines-strategy).)
* As soon as you have 25 copper ore and 25 stone, return to the 0th floor, craft + place a [Furnace](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Furnace), make a [Copper Bar](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Copper_Bar). (Do not wait until you get to the next elevator unless you are really close.)
* Keep the furnace going until you have 5 bars. For reference, you must have all 5 bars crafted by no later than 3 PM.
* Once you get to floor 10, farm floor 10 over and over for copper ore while you wait for the remaining bars to smelt (because you likely will not have time to get to floor 15 before 3 PM).
* As soon as you have the 5 bars ready:
  * Leave the sword + parsnips in the chest. (You will not return to this chest until Spring 11.)
  * Retrieve the furnace + any gems + miscellaneous. Make sure you leave 4 slots open in your inventory.
  * Go to the blacksmith.
* As an extra tip, if you are running late and do not have time for the 5th bar to smelt, then you can still get to the blacksmith by 4 PM, place the furnace inside in blacksmith, smelt the 5th bar, and wait 30 minutes. As long as you are inside the building, Clint will continue to sell to you until 7:10 PM. (Even when Clint moves away from the counter and goes to the anvil, you are still able to interact with the counter.)
* If you fail to craft the bars in time or fail to reach the blacksmith before he closes, then fish for the remainder of the day. For the rest of the route, push everything back one day.
* At the blacksmith:
  * Sell gems.
  * When buying ore, make sure to save at least 3,310g:
    * 2,000g for the pickaxe upgrade.
    * 1,120g for 16 Kale Seeds to get farming level 2 (380 total XP). (You can buy less Kale seeds if you account for the experience gained from mixed seeds & [Rice Shoots](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Rice_Shoot).)
      * 8 XP per Parsnip * 15 Parsnips = 120 XP
      * 380 XP - 120 XP = 260 XP
      * 260 XP / 17 XP per Kale = 16 Kale
      * 16 Kale Seeds * 70g = 1,120g
    * 60g for 1 Bean Starter.
    * 80g for 1 Cauliflower Seeds (not necessary if you have one from a mixed seed).
    * 50g for 1 Potato Seeds (not necessary if you have one from a mixed seed).
  * Buy up to 25 iron ore (accounting for iron ore gained from fishing chests).
  * Buy up to 25 gold ore (accounting for gold ore gained from fishing chests).
  * Upgrade to the Copper Pickaxe (2000g).
* Go to Pierre's and buy:
  * 1 Bean Starter (60g)
  * 1 Cauliflower Seeds (80g) (not necessary if you have one from a mixed seed)
  * 1 Potato Seeds (50g) (not necessary if you have one from a mixed seed)
  * 16 Kale Seeds (1,120g)
  * With any remaining money, buy additional Kale seeds.
* Go home.
* Plant + water.
* Retrieve the Fiberglass Rod + furnace + iron ore + gold ore + coal + Chubs.
* Go to the mountain lake.
* Place the furnace next to the chest. Smelt 5 iron bars while you fish.
* Fish until 2 AM. Before passing out, fill your inventory with the most expensive items.
  * Leave remaining iron ore + gold ore at the mountain lake chest. (Unless it is going to rain tomorrow; if so, remember to take the furnace with you.)
  * Make a note of how many gold ore you have.
* At the end of the day, you should get:
  * Farming 0 --> 1
  * Mining 0 --> 1
  * Fishing 7 --> 8

### Spring 6

* Water.
  * If any of your spring bundle crops got eaten by a crow, make a note of it and re-purchase the seed from Pierre when convenient.
* Craft and place a scarecrow.
* Chop trees until 7:40 AM.
* Empty inventory + retrieve Fiberglass Rod.
* Go into town from the Bus Stop. You will trigger the community center cutscene; **do not skip the cutscene**.
  * This is because if you skip the cutscene, you will be placed at the entrance to town. If you watch it, you will be placed next to the community center.
* Go into the community center and touch the Golden Scroll square (to start the quest).
* Go to the mountain lake and fish until 1 AM. Fill your inventory with 5 iron bars + the most expensive items to sell.
* Go home.
* Out of your sellable items, ship however much will give you 5,000g for the Steel Pickaxe upgrade + however much gold to buy up to 25 gold ore.
  * If you do not have enough, sell Chubs. (Remember, sell the lowest-quality ones first.)
* It should be 2 AM immediately after selling. If not, cut down grass and pass out.

### Spring 7

* Check the Queen of Sauce for the [Stir Fry](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stir_Fry) recipie.
* Check the mail until you get the wizard's letter.
* Water.
* Empty inventory. Retrieve 5 iron bars + a present for Lewis (optional).
  * An Earth Crystal or a gem is an easy gift.
* Go to the wizard (to trigger the cutscene).
* Empty out the contents of the forest river chest (optional).
* Go to Lewis and give him a birthday present (optional).
* Go to the blacksmith:
  * Buy up to 25 gold ore.
  * Upgrade to the Steel Pickaxe (5,000g).
* Fish at the mountain lake until 2 AM, then pass out.
* At the end of the day, you should get:
  * Fishing 8 --> 9

### Spring 8

* Water.
* Out of your sellable items, ship however much will give you 12,000g.
  * This is for the Gold Pickaxe upgrade (10,000g) + the backpack upgrade (2,000g).
* Fish at the mountain lake until 2 AM, then pass out.

### Spring 9

* Water.
* Chop wood until around 8 AM.
* Empty inventory. Retrieve the Fiberglass Rod.
* Go to the blacksmith and upgrade to the Gold Pickaxe (10,000g).
* Go to Pierre's and buy the backpack upgrade (2,000g).
* Fish at the mountain lake until 2 AM, then pass out.
* At the end of the day, you should get:
  * Fishing 9 --> 10 (choose Angler profession)
* If you do not get fishing level 10 today, then you will get it after the next day of fishing. This does not change the route in any meaningful way.

### Spring 10

* Water.
* Grab mushrooms from the cave.
* Calculate how many additional kale you need to get to farming level 6.
  * 8 XP per Parsnip * 15 Parsnips = 120 XP
  * 17 XP per Kale * 16 Kale = 272 XP
  * 3300 total XP - 120 XP - 272 XP = 2908 XP needed
  * 2908 XP / 17 = 172 Kale
  * 172 Kale Seeds * 70g = 12,040g
* If you are level 10 fishing, ship enough fish to buy half of the Kale Seeds necessary (6,020g). (We will plant the Kale in two batches.)
  * Two batches is optimal because we don't want to craft more [Sprinklers](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Crafting#Sprinklers) than necessary. This allows for the maximum amount of iron bars to craft Quality Sprinklers on Spring 28.
* If you are not level 10 fishing, then don't ship any fish right now (because you will miss out on 25% of the gold). Tomorrow, you will have to sell the fish directly to Willy.
* Empty inventory. Retrieve Fiberglass Rod.
* If you have less than 100 bait on the rod, also retrieve a few fish.
* Give Vincent a birthday present (optional).
  * A [Daffodil](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Daffodil) or a gem is a good gift.
  * You will get there before he wakes up, so fish in the town river until he comes outside.
* If you need bait, go to Willy, sell the fish, buy more bait.
* Fish at the mountain lake until 2 AM, then pass out. Remember to take your furnace with you (because we will take it to the mines tomorrow).

### Spring 11

* Harvest the Kale. (This should get to you farming level 2.)
* Start hoeing squares in a sprinkler-pattern. (Do not water any squares.)
* Leave the farm at around 8:00 AM.
* Go to Willy to sell fish if you did not ship any fish yesterday.
* Go to the blacksmith. Retrieve the gold pickaxe.
* Go to Pierre's and buy the previously calculated amount of Kale Seeds. (6,020g)
* Go back to the farm and finish hoeing + planting. (Do not water any squares.)
  * You can optionally craft and place [Cobblestone Path](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Cobblestone_Path) to mark where the future sprinklers will go.
  * We do not need to water the Kale until Spring 14.
* Go to the mines and place the furnace. Keep the furnace going with smelting bars.
* Mine until 2 AM, then pass out.
  * As you get more copper, craft + place 3 more furnaces (to have 4 in total).
* At the end of the day, you should get:
  * Farming 0 --> 1

### Spring 12

* Grab mushrooms from the cave.
* Mine until 2 AM, then pass out.

### Spring 13

* Mine until 2 AM, then pass out.

### Spring 14

* Check the Queen of Sauce for the [Coleslaw](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Coleslaw) recipie.
* Grab mushrooms from the cave.
* Go to the mines until 12 AM.
* If you do not have enough ore for the rest of the sprinklers that you need, then farm ore on floor 21/41 before continuing to decend in the mines.
* If you reach the bottom of the mines, revert to farming more ore. (You can reach floor 120 anywhere between Spring 14 through Spring 18, depending on how well you play, how lucky you are, and whether or not you took days off to fish in the rain.)
  * Once you have all of the (normal) sprinklers made, copper ore is only needed for tool upgrades. Lots of iron ore and gold ore will be needed for Quality Sprinklers.
* At 12 AM, go home and craft + place as many sprinklers as possible. (If you do not have enough sprinklers to cover all of the crops, that is okay.)
* Ship items to get up to 42,500g.
  * If you don't have enough, then only get up to 32,500g. Tomorrow, don't buy the 10,000g bundle. (In most runs, you will not have enough.)
* It should be 2 AM after this. If not, cut down grass and pass out.

### Spring 15

* Salmonberries start spawning today, but do not venture too far out of your way to harvest them. (They are not worth a lot of extra time for the little energy that they return.)
* Water the crops that are not yet covered by sprinklers (if any).
* Empty inventory. Retrieve 4 [Spring Foraging Bundle](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bundles#Spring_Foraging_Bundle) items + 4 [Spring Crops Bundle](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bundles#Spring_Crops_Bundle) items + 3 [Blacksmith's Bundle](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bundles#Blacksmiths_Bundle) items + 4 [Geologist's Bundle](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bundles#Geologists_Bundle) items + 2 [Adventurer's Bundle](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bundles#Adventurers_Bundle) items.
* Go to the community center and complete the bundles for these items.
  * Remember to exit out of the Golden Scroll after completing one of the Boiler Room bundles in order to prevent getting trapped in the bugged cutscene.
* Also complete the vault bundles.
* Go home and place the [Crystalarium](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Crystalarium) and stick a diamond in it.
* Empty inventory and go to the mines.
* If you do not have enough ore for the rest of the sprinklers that you need, then farm ore on floor 21/41 before continuing to decend in the mines.
* Mine until 2 AM, then pass out. If you still need to craft more sprinklers, remember to leave the smelted bars in your inventory.
* At the end of the day, you will unlock the [Minecarts](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Minecart).

### Spring 16

* Grab mushrooms from the cave.
* Water the crops that are not yet covered by sprinklers (if any).
* Use the bars smelted on the previous day to craft more sprinklers (if needed).
* If the Skull Caverns are unlocked, get as far down as you can. (See [General Skull Cavern Strategy](#general-skull-cavern-strategy).)
* Otherwise, mine until 2 AM. (Remember to use the minecarts to get there faster.)

### Spring 17 & Beyond

* If you have not already gotten to floor 120 of the mines, get that done as soon as possible.
* Furthermore, if you need more gold to finish the vault, then fish at the mountain lake, and finish the vault as soon as possible.
  * If you still need to do both of these things, then you should time it such that you finish both of them on the same day. (Because the bus will not be repaired until the next day.)
* Start to do Skull Cavern runs as soon as possible. (See [General Skull Cavern Strategy](#general-skull-cavern-strategy).)
* During periods of downtime, you can:
  * Start to clear debris on the farm where your Quality Sprinklers + Starfruit crop will go.
  * Craft + place Quality Sprinklers, craft + place Scarecrows.
  * Hoe + plant Parsnips (as a "linger crop" to keep the squares watered on Summer 1).
  * Farm more ore in the mines (on floor 20/40/80).

### Spring 19

* Starting today, you need to start upgrading your tools. The axe needs to be upgraded twice and the hoe needs to be upgraded twice. Thus, you should have both tools finished by Spring 25. (19 --> 21 --> 23 --> 25)
  * Upgrading the axe is optinoal; you can forgo it if you want more money to purchase Starfruit on Spring 28.

### Spring 25

* You must buy [Deluxe Speed-Gro](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Deluxe_Speed-Gro) from the Oasis today (so that you can have 3 crops of [Starfruit](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Starfruit)).
  * Deluxe Speed-Gro is only sold on Thursdays and you need it by Summer 1.
* You should be aiming to buy around 540 Deluxe Speed-Gro (for a batch of 540 Starfruit). Plan to buy the next batch Speed-Gro batch on Summer 4.

## Appendix A: Recommended Restrictions

Some techniques and strategies are considered to be cheating by some players, and not cheating by other players. In general, the best Stardew Valley players are able to complete difficult challenges (e.g. all Grandpa points by the end of the first year) without resorting to any of these borderline strategies. In other words, the game is generally so easy that players should aim to play in a ruleset that makes things as difficult as possible.

The guide is designed for the kind of player who is using the following self-imposed restrictions:

* Choosing the Community Center path instead of the Joja path.
  * It is generally more interesting and more difficult to choose the Community Center. Feel free to use the Joja path if you are doing a challenge run in which the Joja path is optimal for the given objective (e.g. pure min-max of money). Some adjustments to the given route will be needed.
* No using glitches / bugs.
* No cheats (e.g. Cheat Engine).
* No mods.
  * Some [quality-of-life mods](#appendix-a-mods) are okay if they provide no actual gameplay advantage.
* No restarting a day in the middle of a run. If a mistake is made, you must continue on with the run or restart all the way back to a new save file.
* No restarting the first day over and over to guarantee an artifact / multiple Spring Onions / etc.
  * Since you are allowed to reset from day N to day 1, it follows that you should be allowed to reset from day 1 to day 1. But if you want, you can force yourself to keep playing a suboptimal day 1 as an additional challenge. (An optimal day 1 is probably not necessary for most runs.)
* No using [Stardew Predictor](https://mouseypounds.github.io/stardew-predictor/) or similar methods to derive information from your save file.
* No using a predictor to know beforehand what specific tiles will yield a gold-quality crop.
* No using the screenshot feature in the menu to peek outside of the bounds of what you are normally supposed to see.
* No animation canceling (e.g. to swing a pickaxe extra fast).
* You are allowed to use [Stardew Checkup](https://mouseypounds.github.io/stardew-checkup/) (since it is easier than manually writing down all of the items you donate to the museum).

The reasons for not allowing the restarting of a day are twofold:

* First, if you allow restarting a day as many times as you want, it removes the execution aspect of the game. Mistakes become completely inconsequential: simply restart the day over and over until you execute perfectly. This trivializes the game.
* Furthermore, consider that when players are forced to improvise on-the-fly after a mistake is made, it promotes interesting gameplay. Players have to quickly think "on their feet", coming up with an alternate plan or an intelligent way to mitigate the mistake.
* Second, resetting a day allows for unfair knowledge. For example, players can check what the Traveling Cart has, and then reset the day if it does not sell anything useful, "regaining" all of the time that it took to walk down there. Or, players could wander through the world and map out where every foraging spawn happened to be for that particular day so that they could run directly to all of the spawns.
* If resetting a day is allowed, then it follows that for players to correctly min-max, they would be required to play each day multiple times in order to fully "explore" it before attempting their real play-through. Most people would probably agree that exploring *every single day* in this fashion would be extremely tedious and is probably not in the spirit of what the game is supposed to be.

While I am sure that there are some arbitrary challenges that are so difficult that they require before-hand knowledge of the various elements of the game, all of the challenges that I know about are completable by skilled players without having to resort to this.

## Appendix B: Mods

Some mods add additional content into the game, which changes the calculus of what the optimal thing to do on each day is. We do not use any of these mods and prefer to min-max the vanilla game. With that said, we recommend that everyone use some of the excellent quality-of-life mods out there (that do not interfere with the vanilla strategies).

#### [UI Info Suite](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1150)

This mod is a compilation of several different features:

* *Display an icon that represents the current days luck* - This is not considered cheating since if you place the TV next to your bed, it wastes no in-game time to check the luck of the day.
* *Display experience point gains & Display a dynamic experience bar that changes based on your current tool or location* - This is not considered cheating because you can manually track your experience for each skill by keeping a running tally on a piece of paper as you forage things and so forth. In vanilla, you can also see your current level in the skills tab of the menu.
* *Display more accurate heart levels* - This is not considered cheating because you can manually track what each person's heart levels are on paper.
* *Display more information on item mouse overs, including items that are still needed for bundles* - This is not considered cheating because you can just pause the game and look up the item on the wiki.
* *View calendar and quest billboard anywhere* - Viewing the calendar is not considered cheating because you could just pause the game and bring up the [Calendar](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Calendar) page on the wiki. However, viewing the billboard anywhere is considered cheating, because you save time from having to walk to Pierre's. Either don't ever click on the billboard in the pause menu or simply turn off the feature in the "UI Info Mod Options" tab of the menu.
* *Display icons over animals that need petting* - Probably only considered cheating if you have a ton of animals; most runs only buy one of each animal (which is subsequently trivial to keep track of).
* *Display crop type and days until harvest on mouseover* - Not cheating because you can write down what day you plant a crop. In the case of mixed seeds, it is still not cheating because you can go to the wiki and look up what crop it is based on the image tile of the seed.
* *Display icon when animal has item yield (milk, wool)* - Could be cheating in the case where you use the notifications to intentionally skip milking a cow, for example. Don't do that. Most runs use [Auto-Grabbers](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Auto-Grabber), so this quickly becomes a non-issue.
* *Sprinkler, scarecrow, beehive and junimo hut ranges* - Not considered cheating because you can just pause the game and count the number of squares that it is supposed to cover.
* *Display npc locations on map* - Not considered cheating because you can just go to the villager's page on the wiki and look up their schedule for the day.
* *Skip the intro by pressing the Escape key* - In this case, the intro refers to the cutscene that appears before you get to the main menu.
* *Display an icon for Queen of Sauce when she is airing a recipe you don't already know* - Not considered cheating because the show airs on predictable days and it wastes no in-game time to check the TV.
* *Display an icon when Clint is upgrading one of your tools. Icon will tell you how long until the tool is finished and shows you which tool you are upgrading.* - Not considered cheating because you can just write down when you give a tool to Clint.

#### [Always Scroll Map](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2733)

Allows the screen to be centered on the player. It can be toggled on and off by pressing ";" and the default behavior is customizable. This is helpful for restocking massive amounts of jars/kegs in a Shed, for example, because when the screen is centered, you need to do a lot less mouse movements. This is not considered cheating because the "skill" difference between moving the mouse a little more while restocking a shed or planting crops is negliable.

#### [Running Late](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3518)

This prevents the game from rounding the time to the nearest 10 minutes. It is hard to believe that this simple feature is not in the vanilla game.

#### [Skip Intro](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/533)

In this case, the intro refers to the cutscene that appears before you get to the main menu. Being forced to watch an unskippable intro cutscene every time you want to play the game is inexcusable.

#### [Fast Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1089)

By default, this mod speeds up a lot of different animations, so it must be customized using the "config.json" file to prevent cheating. All values should be set to 1 with the exception of:

* TitleMenuTransitionSpeed - Set this to 20 to make the title screen more functional.
* LoadGameBlinkSpeed - Set this to 20 to make the title screen more functional.
* EatAndDrinkSpeed - Set this to 2 (or higher) to speed up the rate of the eating animation. This is not considered cheating because the game is paused when the animation is occurring.
* BreakGeodeSpeed - Set this to 20 to make geodes break open instantly. This is not considered cheating because the game is paused when the animation is occurring.

#### [Energy Count](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4272)

This always shows the numerical energy count on screen so that you don't have to constantly pause the game and mouse over the energy bar in order to see it. It also shows an accurate count when the energy drops into negative values, which is helpful.

<br />

## TTD

* add date of getting mushroom cave (should be Spring 9)
* add dates to get mushrooms
