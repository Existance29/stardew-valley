# Stardew Valley Min-Max Routing / Strategy

* This is a "min-max" guide for a Stardew Valley run created by [BlackSight6](https://old.reddit.com/user/BlackSight6) & [Zamiell](https://www.twitch.tv/Zamiell).
* This route / strategy is designed for experienced Stardew players; knowledge of many game mechanics is assumed. While the guide is fairly in-depth, obvious things will not be explained.
* We assume some restrictions/rules, which makes this different from other min-max guides out there.
* Many guides out there are designed for older versions of the game. This guide is designed for [version 1.4.5](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Version_History). (In this version, explosive ammo is nerfed, the mushroom floor is nerfed, and so forth.)

## Preface

Before we start with the route, let's first go over some high-level things that you need to know over the course of the run.

### Goal

The general goal of this route is to maximize the total amount of money gained by the end of the first season. This leaves you in a good position to accomplish whatever goals that you want, whether it be to continue to min-max money, or to 100% your save file (e.g. max friendship with every villager, etc.).

### Route Overview

* This route starts off by doing a ton of fishing, unlocking the Skull Caverns as soon as possible. One the Skull Caverns are opened, you craft and sell Iridium Bars to make a lot of money.
  * Routes that involve fishing + Skull Caverns are overall more profitable than the typical naieve strategy of planting Strawberries.
* With the money, you buy a lot of Starfruit + Deluxe Speed Grow, with the goal to get three Starfruit harvests during Summer (and with all of the crops being automatically watered by Quality Sprinklers).

### Rules

Some techniques and strategies are considered to be cheating by some players, and not cheating by other players. In general, the best Stardew Valley players are able to complete difficult challenges (e.g. all Grandpa points by the end of the first year) without resorting to any of these borderline strategies. In other words, the game is generally so easy that players should aim to play in a ruleset that makes things as difficult as possible.

The guide is designed for the kind of player who is using the following self-imposed restrictions:

* Choosing the Community Center path instead of the Joja path.
  * It is generally more interesting and more difficult to choose the Community Center. Feel free to use the Joja path if you are doing a challenge run in which the Joja path is optimal for the given objective (e.g. pure min-max of money). Some adjustments to the given route will be needed.
* No using glitches / bugs.
* No cheats (e.g. Cheat Engine).
* No mods.
  * Some [quality-of-life mods](#appendix-a-mods) are okay if they provide no actual gameplay advantage.
* No restarting a day in the middle of a run. If a mistake is made, you must continue on with the run or restart all the way back to a new save file.
* No restarting the first day over and over to guarantee an artifact / multiple Spring Onions / etc.
  * Since you are allowed to reset from day N to day 1, it follows that you should be allowed to reset from day 1 to day 1. But if you want, you can force yourself to keep playing a suboptimal day 1 as an additional challenge. (An optimal day 1 is probably not necessary for most runs.)
* No using [Stardew Predictor](https://mouseypounds.github.io/stardew-predictor/) or similar methods to derive information from your save file.
* No using a predictor to know beforehand what specific tiles will yield a gold-quality crop.
* No editing the save file (or using a mod) to make the game zoom out past the normal "75%" value.
* No using the screenshot feature in the menu to peek outside of the bounds of what you are normally supposed to see.
* No animation canceling (e.g. to swing a pickaxe extra fast).
* You are allowed to use [Stardew Checkup](https://mouseypounds.github.io/stardew-checkup/) (since it is easier than manually writing down all of the items you donate to the museum).

The reasons for not allowing the restarting of a day are twofold:

* First, if you allow restarting a day as many times as you want, it removes the execution aspect of the challenge. Mistakes are inconsequential: simply restart the day over and over until you execute perfectly.
* Second, it allows for unfair knowledge. For examp4le, players can check what the Traveling Cart has, and then reset the day if it does not sell anything useful, "regaining" all of the time that it took to walk down there. If you allow this, then it follows that you should allow Stardew Predictor, since it is just a shortcut to re-playing the same day a bunch of times and gathering lots of information.
  
While I am sure that there are some arbitrary challenges that are so difficult that they require before-hand knowledge, all of the challenges that I know about are completable by skilled players without resorting to this.

### Gold per Energy List (GPE)

In general, you should always eat items with the [lowest gold to energy ratio](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Zamiel/Gold_to_Energy_Ratios). For this route, you can use the following simple rule:

* save everything with a ratio equal to or less than 2 for eating
* sell everything with a ratio above 2

### Energy Recovery Mechanics

* On the day after a player has gained one or more skill level increases, they will always start with full energy, even if they passed out on the previous day. They will also still start with full energy even if they were below 0 energy and had the "exhausted" icon showing above the energy bar.
  * Note that with this route, players will gain one or more skill level increases on every single day until Spring 12.
* When a player passes out at 2 AM, 10% of their gold is taken (maxing out at 1000g). However, if the player has no gold in their inventory, they will incur no penalty. Or, if they have a very small amount of gold, the resulting gold loss will be completely trivial (e.g. losing 5g with a bank of 50g).
* When a player falls asleep at midnight or earlier, they will regenerate 100% of their energy. When a player falls asleep after 12 AM, they will regenerate a variable percentage of energy depending on how late it was. For example, at 1 AM, they will regenerate 75% of their energy, and at 2 AM, they will regenerate 50% of their energy.
* Thus, we can combine the above three mechanics to stay up to 2 AM on almost every single day with no consequences.

### General Fishing Strategy

* Prioritize eating [Green Algae](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Green_Algae) (1.15 ratio), then [Joja Cola](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Joja_Cola) (1.92 ratio), then the highest-quality [Chub](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Chub).
* Prioritize capturing fishing chests over perfect fish. (The rewards can be extremely good.)
* Make sure that you have at least 5 inventory slots open at all times by moving fish from your inventory into the chest. (This is because you can catch 1 new fish + get up to 4 items from a fishing chest.)
* When casting at 7 energy or below, you will correctly drop into the appropriate amount of negative energy, even though the energy meter will appear to be at 0. For example, when casting at 2 energy, you will go to -6 energy. And then, after eating a Green Algae to restore 13 energy, you will go back to positive 7 energy. Thus, it is mostly irrelevant whether or not you accidentally slip past 0 energy while fishing (at least as long as you get a level up before the next day to remove the exhaustion).
* At the end of the fishing session (e.g. usually at 1:50 AM), fill up your inventory with all of the most expensive fish/items from the chest. (You can also leave the fishing pole in the chest to make even more room if you are on Spring 4 or later.)

### General Mines Strategy

* Starting on Spring X, the goal is to go as deep in the mines as possible. As soon as you discover the staircase on a floor, immediately enter it. Do **not** go out of your way to explore the rest of the floor, do **not** kill any additional enemies, do **not** stop to mine any visible metal nodes, do **not** stop to mine any visible gem nodes, etc. (You will easily be able to farm metal later on.)
* Every time you get to a new elevator floor, return to the 0th floor and empty your inventory in the chest. If you are at level 2 mining or above, remember to keep the stone on you (so that you can craft a [Staircase](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Staircase) on an infested floor).
* On the early floors, skip over mining the gray rocks in favor of the other color rocks. (This is because it takes two hits to destroy a gray rock and one hit to destroy the other ones.)
  * When you have a copper pickaxe or better, this strategy no longer applies, as gray rocks will be destroyed in 1 hit.
  * One alternate strategy would be to intentionally kill all the gray rocks first, because they grant 3 mining XP (as opposed to the 0 XP from normal rocks). This allows the ability to craft Staircases on the second day of mining (as opposed to only getting the ability on the 3rd day of mining). While this is useful for bypassing infested floors, the strategy will only pay off if you happen to get an infested floor on the 2nd day of mining. Thus, I do not believe that this strategy is worth it.
* If the floor is small, search it for an existing staircase before starting to kill enemies or mine rocks. (Do not bother to do this if the floor is medium/large, as it will be a huge waste of time.)
* If the floor is small and you can see that there are 3 or less total enemies, kill all the the enemies first. This will increase your chance of spawning a staircase from a rock by 4%.
* If there are 4 or more enemies on the floor, avoid all the enemies (if possible) and **only** mine rocks. The exception is if it is a "somewhat annoyed" or "very displeased" luck day; the 4% chance increase can help a lot in this case.
* If you get lucky enough to randomly get a club weapon drop, you can use it to deal massive amounts of damage by right clicking and then spam left clicking. (This is referred to as the "club spam" strategy.) For this reason, it usually always better to use a club over a sword or dagger.

### Weather Modifications

* The best fishing spot for non-rainy days is the mountain lake.
  * Not only does it have the highest best gold per hour ratio, it also has the easiest difficulty fish. Perfect catches are the best way to level up the fishing skill.
* The best fishing spot for rainy days is the forest river.
  * This is because Catfish sell for 200g. They are difficult to catch with low fishing skill, but you should still be able to catch around 50% of them.
* Rain will occur randomly on different days, depending on the RNG seed of your particular save file.
* Thus, if the guide says to fish at the mountain lake, and it happens to be raining for you, then go to the forest river instead.
* Furthermore, if the guide says to mine, and it happens to be raining for you, then you might want to disregard mining and go to fish at the forest river. (Because the money from Catfish is really good.)

### Other Notes

* If your character's gender does not matter to you, then it is optimal to choose a female, as they get 500g in the mail instead of a [Cookie](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Cookie).
* Always set the game options to zoom out as far as possible. This makes you waste less time while foraging & mining.
* For reference, it is possible to get up to 22 Spring Onions on Spring 1. (It is not required to get any Spring Onions on Spring 1, but it certainly helps.)
* Don't read any of your mail unless explicitly told to by the guide.
  * This is because at many points in the run, you need to stay at 0 gold for the purposes of staying out late. Since some letters contain gold, you want to only check the mail at specific points.
* Choose Mushrooms over Bats for the Cave. This is for several reasons:
  * The cave restocks faster, granting more total items.
  * On average, mushrooms sell for more than fruit.
  * Common Mushrooms are a good energy food. They have high GPE and you can build up a large stack of them.

## The Route

### Spring 1

The plan for the day is to meet everybody in the town and save money for tomorrow so that we can buy the [Fiberglass Rod](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Fiberglass_Rod) for 1,800g as soon as possible. (We want to meet everybody so that we can complete the "Introductions" quest in order to unlock the "How to Win Friends" for an extra 100g on Spring 2.)

An alternate strategy for Spring 1 would be to ignore all of the villagers and focus on killing every weed on the map + every weed on the farm, which has the advantage of getting a few more mixed seeds planted on the first day. However, in the "meet everybody" route, you still kill plenty of weeds, making the overall number of mixed seeds very similiar. Thus, the marginal number of mixed seeds gathered in the alternate route is not worth more than the early 100g.

* Take the Parsnip Seeds.
* Immediately chop down trees until foraging level 1. We want to get level 1 before we leave to go foraging so that we have a chance to get silver-quality Spring Onions and such. (Focus on **only** chopping down trees. The route is very tight.)
  * Only chop down Maple and Pine trees, not Oak trees. (We won't get any acorns for felling an Oak tree until Spring 2 and acorns are precious.)
  * For the same reason, do not axe/hoe any seeds in the ground until Spring 2, or they will be destroyed.
  * Do not chop the stumps; only chop a tree until it falls, then move on to the next one. (It yields more wood and more foraging XP to do it this way.)
  * Do not chop wood tiles until you are already at foraging level 1 (as they do not provide any foraging XP).
  * As soon as a tree starts to fall, walk towards where the wood will spawn and immediately pause the game. This prevents in-game time from passing, but the tree falling animation will still complete. Additionally, all of the wood will automatically be collected by the player while the game is still paused. (You should use this strategy whenever you are chopping trees and not bothering to kill the stumps.)
* Once foraging level 1, craft a chest, place it next to the house, and empty all inventory except for scythe + axe + pickaxe + hoe.
* Exit south to the forest. (The time should be around 9:20 AM.)
* Head left past the Traveling Cart area, down to the Abandoned House, right to the Spring Onion area, and up to Marnie's Ranch.
  * Pick up all foragables along the way.
  * Try to kill as many weeds as possible, but don't go too far out of your way for just 1 weed (since you need to make it to Jas at 11 AM).
* Meet Jas as she exits her house around 11:20 AM.
* Meet Haley as she walks towards Leah's house.
* Go to town.
* Check the two garbage cans next to Jodi's house + Haley's house.
* Meet Emily inside of her house.
* Meet Marnie outside of Pierre's General Store.
* Meet Penny to the left of the graveyard.
* Go to the beach.
* Leave any beach foraging items on the ground. (We don't have the inventory space right now and we can just collect them on Spring 2.)
* Meet Elliott outside of his cabin.
* Check for + hoe artifact spots.
* Go to town.
* If you got an artifact, donate it to the museum and claim the reward.
* Check the garbage cans next to the museum + blacksmith.
* Meet Clint inside of the blacksmith.
* Meet Pam + Sam + Shane inside of JojaMart.
* Clear the weeds north-west of JojaMart.
* Meet Abigale on the bridge.
* Meet Maru. (She is walking south to the benches.)
* Check the garbage can next to Lewis' house.
* Meet Evelyn + Caroline + Jodi + Vincent + Harvey west of Lewis' house.
* Meet Leah + Pierre inside of Pierre's General Store.
* Check the garbage can next to the Saloon.
* Meet Gus in the Saloon.
* Check the garbage can next to George's house.
* Meet George + Alex inside of their house. (Alex finishes his workout and leaves his room at 4 PM.)
* Go back to the farm. (Leave all of the foragables at the Bus Stop on the ground for now.)
* Empty your inventory. Keep the tools.
* Clear a path to the Backwoods. Exit to the Backwoods around 6:10 PM.
* Meet Linus outside of his tent.
* Meet Demetrius south-east of their house.
* Meet Sebastian as he leaves his house. (If you got here before 7 PM, then you will have to idle until he comes out of his room at 6:40 PM. This is wasted time that you could have used to kill more weeds elsewhere.)
* Go south to the community center.
* Kill the weeds to the left of the community center.
* Kill the weeds to the left of the fountain.
* Go home. (Get any foragables at the Bus Stop that you missed earlier.)
* Hoe + plant + water Parsnip Seeds + Mixed Seeds.
* Eat all Spring Onions. (They are near-worthless to sell.)
* Chop wood until around 4-6 energy left.
* Kill weeds + grass until around 1:30 AM.
* Sell all but 20 fiber, all sap, all clay + all pinecones + extra spring foraging items + any food from the garbage cans (except for [Field Snack](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Field_Snack)).
  * In other words, keep stone + wood + coal + 20 fiber + 1 of each spring foragable.
  * Normally, we would save Leeks, Dandelions, and food from the garbage cans to eat, since they have a GPE ratio of under 2. However, we need as much money as possible for Spring 2, so we need to sell them today as an exception to the rule.
* Hoe + plant + water any remaining mixed seeds.
  * Note that you can work past 0 energy and become exhausted with no penalty carrying over to Spring 2 (because you will level up foraging).
* Go to bed at 2 AM. (We don't want to incur the gold penalty.)
* At the end of the day, you should get:
  * Foraging 0 --> 1

### Spring 2

* Move the TV next to the bed (so that later on you can immediately check it upon waking up). I also like to delete the carpet so that it does not get in the way, but that is optional.
  * You need to do this on Spring 1 or Spring 2, because you will have a full inventory on subsequent days.
* Read all of the mail (three letters in total). (We need to read Willy's letter in order to be given the [Bamboo Pole](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bamboo_Pole).)
* Water.
* Craft a Chest and take it with you.
* Empty all inventory in the chest except for the Chest + 1 rock.
* Check the garbage cans next to the George's house + next to the Saloon + next to Lewis' house.
* Go to the beach and get the Bamboo Pole.
* Give the rock to Willy and claim the reward for the "How To Win Friends" quest.
* Place the chest on the bottom-right hand corner of the pier.
* Fish facing right from the pier. Use minimum casts.
  * This gives a greater probability to catch easier fish and also saves time on casting/reeling animations.
* At 9 AM, destroy the Bamboo Pole and buy the [Training Rod](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Training_Rod) from Willy for 25g.
  * The Training Rod will allow more perfect catches; leveling up the fishing skill with perfect catches is more important than getting high-quality fish.
* Fish until you have enough fish to sell to get up to 1,800g. (Continue using minimum casts.)
* Destroy the Training Rod and buy the [Fiberglass Rod](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Fiberglass_Rod) from Willy for 1,800g. Also, buy as much [Bait](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bait_(item)) as possible (5g each) and equip it on the new rod.
  * Even though we will have less perfect catches, the Fiberglass Rod will allow us to gain experience faster because of the bait.
* Fish using max casts at the same spot as before.
* At 4:30 PM, if you don't have enough bait to finish out the day, go to Willy and buy more.
* Fish until 2 AM. Before passing out, leave all of the fish in the chest. (We will sell them to Willy tomorrow.)
* At the end of the day, you should get:
  * Fishing 0 --> 4

### Spring 3

* (It always rains on this day.)
* Empty all inventory in the chest except for the Fiberglass Rod.
* If you got a copper ore while fishing yesterday, drop it on the ground and pick it up (to initiate the Clint cutscene tomorrow). You can now skip buying copper ore from Clint later on today.
* Go to the beach. (On the way, check the same 3 garbage cans as yesterday.)
* Fish until 9 AM.
* At Willy's shop, sell all fish + any extra beach foraging items. Buy bait until you only have 75g left.
  * Remember to keep one of each Crab Pot Bundle item.
* Empty the contents of the chest and pick it up. (To pick up a chest without a pickaxe, select an empty square on the toolbar and spam left-click.)
* Go to Clint and buy a copper ore (75g). Drop it on the ground and pick it back up (to initiate the Clint cutscene tomorrow).
* Go to the forest river. The best spot to fish is casting downwards 6 tiles to the left of Leah's door. Place the chest one tile above and to the right of you.
  * For reference, see [the pathing infographic](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/4/44/Pathing-Forest.jpg) on the wiki.
* Fish until 2 AM. Before passing out, fill your inventory with any gems, any copper ore, any coal, and the most expensive fish.
* At the end of the day, you should get:
  * Fishing 4 --> 6 (choose Fisher profession)

### Spring 4

[old]

* Water.
* Chop 50 wood, craft a Chest, and put it in storage. (Remember to take your Scythe before going to chop wood.)
* Fish at the mountain lake until 2 AM, then pass out.
* At the end of the day, you should get:
  * Fishing 6 --> ?

### Spring 5

* From here on out, check the TV every single day to reveal the current day's luck.
* Harvest the Parsnips and make a note of how many you harvested.
* (Do not claim the reward for the parsnip quest, since we want to stay at 0 gold.)
* Water any remaining Mixed Seeds.
* Chop 100 wood (for 2 crafting Scarecrows later on).
* Clear the farm, make max Basic Fertilizer, hoe + fertilizer around 150-200 squares in preparation for tomorrow.
* Put all clay + Geodes + fish in the shipping bin.
* If a very unlucky day:
  * Fish at the mountain lake until 12:30 AM and then go home.
  * Put all fish in the shipping bin. (Since Willy does not work on Saturdays, we must sell them like this in order to have the necessary money for Kale. Otherwise, we would be able to fish until 2 AM.)
* Otherwise:
  * Retrieve the Pickaxe + Chest + all Parsnips from the chest.
  * Go to the mines, place the Chest to the right of the elevator.
  * Get as low as possible.
  * If it is near 2 AM and you know that you cannot reach the next elevator by the end of the night, then farm copper until 2 AM, then pass out.
  * (Even though we need as much money as possible on Spring 6, we do not have to leave the mines to because we can sell the gems to Clint tomorrow.)
* At the end of the day, you should get (assuming a mining day):
  * Farming 0 --> 2
  * Mining 0 --> 1
  * Combat 0 --> 1

### Spring 6

* Claim the reward for any outstanding quests from the journal.
* Read all of the mail.
* If you mined on Spring 5, make a furnace and smelt 5 Copper Bars (while doing other tasks). Keep the Copper Bars in your inventory.
  * Save all remaining copper for more Furnaces.
* Harvest any mixed seeds and make a note of how many you harvested.
* Pause the game and:
  * Calculate how much farming experience you currently have.
    * Parnips give 8 XP each.
  * Calculate how many Kale you would need to get farming level 6, which is 3300 total XP.
    * Kale gives 17 XP each.
    * e.g. (3300 - current XP) / 17
    * We need level 6 farming in order to get the Quality Sprinkler recipe. (The route will not work otherwise.)
  * Calculate how much gold you would need to buy that many Kale Seeds at 70g a seed. (It will be around 173 Kale Seeds for 12,110g.)
* Start clearing + hoeing + watering enough squares for all your Kale.
  * It is helpful to use the crop pattern for Quality Sprinklers, even though you have no Quality Sprinklers. That way you can transition easier later on.
* At 8 AM, go into town from the Bus Stop. You will trigger the community center cutscene; **do not skip the cutscene**.
  * This is because if you skip the cutscene, you will be placed at the entrance to town. If you watch it, you will be placed next to the community center.
* Go to the community center and touch the Golden Scroll square (to start the quest).
* If you mined on Spring 5, go to Clint's, upgrade the Pickaxe and sell all gems.
* Go to Pierre's:
  * Sell low-quality Parsnips until you have enough money for the Kale Seeds.
  * Buy the Kale Seeds.
* Go home, fertilize + plant + water.
* Craft + place 3 Scarecrows.
* (Don't sell anything to stay at 0 gold.)
* Mine/fish until 2 AM, then pass out. (Depending on the day's luck.)
  * If you mine, move the Furnace from the farm to the 0th floor.
* At the end of the day, you should get:
  * Foraging 1 --> 2

### Spring 7-11

* On Spring 7, check the Queen of Sauce for a recipie.
* (Don't sell anything to stay at 0 gold.)
* If you mined for the first time yesterday, make a furnace and smelt 5 Copper Bars (while doing other tasks). Keep the Copper Bars in your inventory.
  * At some point in the day, go into town and upgrade the Pickaxe.
  * Save all remaining copper on more Furnaces.
* Water.
* Retrieve the upgrade pickaxe at some point.
* Mine/fish until 2 AM, then pass out.
* At the end of Spring 7, you should get:
  * Fishing 6 --> 7
* At the end of Spring 8, you should get:
  * Combat 1 --> 2
* At the end of Spring 9, you should get:
  * Mining 1 --> 2
* At the end of Spring 10, you should get:
  * Mining 2 --> 3
* At the end of Spring 11, you should get:
  * Combat 2 --> 3
  * Mining 3 --> 4

### Spring 12

* Harvest.
* Ship everything. (We can't sell anything tomorrow at the fair.)
* Mine/fish until 2 AM, then pass out.

### Spring 13

* Claim the reward for any outstanding quests from the journal.
* Check the mail.
* Mine/fish until around 1 PM, then go to the festival. (The latest you can arrive to the town is 2 PM.)
* Buy max Strawberry Seeds (100g each).
* Clear the farm until 12 PM (to prepare for planting the Strawberry Seeds on day 16), then sleep.

### Spring 14

* Mine/fish until 2 AM, then pass out.

### Spring 15

* Salmonberries start spawning today, but do not venture too far out of your way to harvest them. (They are not worth a lot of extra time for the little energy that they return.)
* Mine/fish until 12:30 AM, then go home.
* Ship all extra items to get as much money as possible for the next day.

### Spring 16

* Hoe + plant + water all Stawberry Seeds.
* Go to Pierre's:
  * Buy the backpack upgrade (1,000g)
  * Buy max Kale Seeds
* Go home
* Hoe + fertilize + plant + water all Kale Seeds.
* At this point, you should have enough sprinklers to cover all your crops. If not, prioritize placing the sprinklers on the plots that are the farthest away from the pond (to minimize travelling back and forth with the watering can).
* Doing all of this should take all day.

### Spring 17

* Water (if not full sprinklers).
* Return to the mines to get any remaining materials needed for sprinklers.

### Spring 20-27

* From this point on you can do pretty much whatever you like for the rest of the season.
  * If you need extra money, fish at the forest river when it is raining for Catfish.

### Spring 22

* Buy + plant Kale. (If you plant it today, it will be ready to harvest on the 28th.)

## Appendix A: Mods

Some mods add additional content into the game, which changes the calculus of what the optimal thing to do on each day is. We don't use any of these mods and prefer to min-max the vanilla game. With that said, we recommend that everyone use some of the excellent quality-of-life mods that preserve the vanilla strategies.

#### [UI Info Suite](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1150)

This mod is a compilation of several different features:

* *Display an icon that represents the current days luck* - This is not considered cheating since if you place the TV next to your bed, it wastes no in-game time to check the luck of the day.
* *Display experience point gains & Display a dynamic experience bar that changes based on your current tool or location* - This is not considered cheating because you can manually track your experience for each skill by keeping a running tally on a piece of paper as you forage things and so forth. In vanilla, you can also see your current level in the skills tab of the menu.
* *Display more accurate heart levels* - This is not considered cheating because you can manually track what each person's heart levels are on paper.
* *Display more information on item mouse overs, including items that are still needed for bundles* - This is not considered cheating because you can just pause the game and look up the item on the wiki.
* *View calendar and quest billboard anywhere* - Viewing the calendar is not considered cheating because you could just pause the game and bring up the [Calendar](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Calendar) page on the wiki. However, viewing the billboard anywhere is considered cheating, because you save time from having to walk to Pierre's. Either don't ever click on the billboard in the pause menu or simply turn off the feature in the "UI Info Mod Options" tab of the menu.
* *Display icons over animals that need petting* - Probably only considered cheating if you have a ton of animals; most runs only buy one of each animal (which is subsequently trivial to keep track of).
* *Display crop type and days until harvest on mouseover* - Not cheating because you can write down what day you plant a crop. In the case of mixed seeds, it is still not cheating because you can go to the wiki and look up what crop it is based on the image tile of the seed.
* *Display icon when animal has item yield (milk, wool)* - Could be cheating in the case where you use the notifications to intentionally skip milking a cow, for example. Don't do that. Most runs use [Auto-Grabbers](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Auto-Grabber), so this quickly becomes a non-issue.
* *Sprinkler, scarecrow, beehive and junimo hut ranges* - Not considered cheating because you can just pause the game and count the number of squares that it is supposed to cover.
* *Display npc locations on map* - Not considered cheating because you can just go to the villager's page on the wiki and look up their schedule for the day.
* *Skip the intro by pressing the Escape key* - In this case, the intro refers to the intro cutscene upon first booting the game.
* *Display an icon for Queen of Sauce when she is airing a recipe you don't already know* - Not considered cheating because the show airs on predictable days and it wastes no in-game time to check the TV.
* *Display an icon when Clint is upgrading one of your tools. Icon will tell you how long until the tool is finished and shows you which tool you are upgrading.* - Not considered cheating because you can just write down when you give a tool to Clint.

#### [Always Scroll Map](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2733)

Allows the screen to be centered on the player. It can be toggled on and off by pressing ";" and the default behavior is customizable. This is helpful for restocking massive amounts of jars/kegs in a Shed, for example, because when the screen is centered, you need to do a lot less mouse movements. This is not considered cheating because the "skill" difference between moving the mouse a little more while restocking a shed or planting crops is negliable.

#### [Running Late](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3518)

This prevents the game from rounding the time to the nearest 10 minutes. It's hard to believe that this simple feature is not in the vanilla game.

#### [Skip Intro](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/533)

In this case, the intro refers to the intro cutscene upon first booting the game. Being forced to watch an unskippable intro cutscene every time you want to play the game is inexcusable.

#### [Fast Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1089)

By default, this mod speeds up a lot of different animations, so it must be customized using the "config.json" file to prevent cheating. All values should be set to 1 with the exception of:

* TitleMenuTransitionSpeed - Set this to 20 to make the title screen more functional.
* LoadGameBlinkSpeed - Set this to 20 to make the title screen more functional.
* EatAndDrinkSpeed - Set this to 2 (or higher) to speed up the rate of the eating animation. This is not considered cheating because the game is paused when the animation is occurring.
* BreakGeodeSpeed - Set this to 20 to make geodes break open instantly. This is not considered cheating because the game is paused when the animation is occurring.
