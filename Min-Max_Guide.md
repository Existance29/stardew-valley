# Stardew Valley Min-Max Routing / Strategy

* This is a "min-max" guide for a Stardew Valley run created by [Zamiel](https://www.twitch.tv/Zamiell).
* This route / strategy is designed for experienced Stardew players; knowledge of many game mechanics is assumed. While the guide is fairly in-depth, obvious things will not be explained.
* We assume some restrictions/rules, which makes this different from other min-max guides out there.
* Many guides out there are designed for older versions of the game. This guide is designed for 1.4.3. (In this version, explosive ammo is nerfed, the mushroom floor is nerfed, and so forth.)
* This guide is based on other people's work:
  * [BlackSight6's 1.4 Spring Min/Max guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/edcm3m/stardew_14_spring_minmax_guide/)
  * [Foxy Fern's 1.4 Spring Min/Max guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/etjtdq/patch_14_minmax_detailed_comprehensive_guide/)

## Preface

Before we start with the route, let's first go over some high-level things that you need to know over the course of the run.

### Rules

The guide is designed for the kind of player who is using the following self-imposed restrictions:

* No mods.
* No using glitches / bugs.
* No 3rd party cheats.
* No using Stardew Predictor (https://mouseypounds.github.io/stardew-predictor/).
* No restarting a day in the middle of a run. (If a mistake is made, you must continue on with the run or restart all the way back to a new save file.)
* No restarting the first day over and over to guarantee an artifact / multiple Spring Onions / etc.

### Gold per Energy List (GPE)

In general, you should always eat items with the [lowest gold to energy ratio](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Zamiel/Gold_to_Energy_Ratios). For this route, you can use the follow simple rule:

* save everything with a ratio equal to or less than 2 for eating
* sell everything with a ratio above 2

### Energy Recovery Mechanics

* On the day after a player has gained one or more skill level increases, they will always start with full energy, even if they passed out on the previous day. They will also still start with full energy even if they were below 0 energy and had the "exhausted" icon showing above the energy bar.
  * Note that with this route, players will gain one or more skill level increases on every single day until Spring ?.
* When a player passes out at 2 AM, 10% of their gold is taken (maxing out at 1000g). However, if the player has no gold in their inventory, they will incur no penalty. Or, if they have a very small amount of gold, the resulting gold loss will be completely trivial (e.g. losing 5g with a bank of 50g).
* When a player falls asleep at midnight or earlier, they will regenerate 100% of their energy. When a player falls asleep after 12 AM, they will regenerate a variable percentage of energy depending on how late it was. For example, at 1 AM, they will regenerate 75% of their energy, and at 2 AM, they will regenerate 50% of their energy.
* Thus, we can combine the above three mechanics to stay up to 2 AM on almost every single day with no consequences.

### General Fishing Strategy

* Create and place a Chest next to where you will be fishing. (You will need two Chests; one for the mountain lake and one for forest river.)
* Prioritize eating Green Algae (1.15 ratio), then Joja Cola (1.92 ratio), then Chub (2.00 ratio).
* Prioritize capturing treasure chests over perfect fish. (The rewards can be extremely good.)
* Make sure that you have at least 5 inventory slots open at all times by moving fish from your inventory into the chest. (This is because you can catch 1 new fish + get up to 4 items from a Treasure Chest.)
* When casting at 7 energy or below, you will correctly drop into the appropriate amount of negative energy, even though the energy meter will appear to be at 0. For example, when casting at 2 energy, you will go to -6 energy. And then, after eating a Green Algae to restore 13 energy, you will go back to positive 7 energy. Thus, it is mostly irrelevant whether or not you accidentally slip past 0 energy while fishing (at least as long as you get a level up before the next day to remove the exhaustion).
* Casting while facing up goes further than casting left or right, which in turn goes further than casting down. This is only important at early fishing levels; more specifices will be noted below on the respective day.
* Casting up or down results in a shorter reeling animation than casting left or right. Since in-game time passes during the reeling animation, at level 4 and beyond, casting up or down is generally better. (It still might be better to fish left or right if you will not be fishing for very long and/or if travelling to a up/down casting spot would take a while, but this will be more rare.)

### General Mines Strategy

* Create and place a Chest to the right of the elevator on the 0th floor.
* Create and place 5 Furnaces to the left of the elevator on the 0th floor.
* Mine all gems and ores on the way + pick up forageables.
* If the floor is small, search it for an existing staircase before starting to kill enemies or mine rocks. (Do not bother to do this if the floor is medium/large, as it will be a huge waste of time.)
* If the level is small, kill all the the enemies first. This will increase your chance of spawning a staircase from a rock by 4%. (Do not bother to do this if the floor is medium/large, as it will be a huge waste of time.)
* In medium/large floors, it is usually better to avoid all the enemies (if possible) and only mine rocks.
  * The exception is if it is a "somewhat annoyed" or "very displeased" luck day; the 4% chance increase helps a lot in this case.
* If you get lucky enough to randomly get a club to drop, you can use it to deal massive amounts of damage by right clicking and then spam left clicking. (This is referred to as the "club spam" strategy.) For this reason, it usually always better to use a club over a sword or dagger.

### Weather Modifications

* The best fishing spot for non-rainy days is the mountain lake.
  * This is because the easiest fish are here and perfect catches are the best way to level up the fishing skill.
* The best fishing spot for rainy days is the forest river.
  * This is because Catfish sell for 200g. They are difficult to catch with low fishing skill, but still possible with some luck.
* Rain will occur randomly on different days, depending on the RNG seed of your particular save file.
* Thus, if the guide says to fish at the mountain lake, and it happens to be raining for you, then go to the forest river instead.
* Furthermore, if the guide says to mine, and it happens to be raining for you, then you should disregard mining and go to fish at the forest river. (Because the money from Catfish is really good.)

### Luck Modifications

* Between Spring 5 and Spring 15, the main activity of the day will depend on the luck.
  * If an very unlucky day (e.g. "very displeased"), you should fish.
  * Otherwise, you should mine.
* However, you can only afford to dedicate two full days to fishing. This means that you might be forced to go to the mines on an very unlucky day.
* For example, say you got a very unlucky day on both Spring 7 and Spring 9 (and spent all of those days fishing). Next, you got a third very unlucky day on Spring 11. In this scenario, since you already took two days off from the mines, you have to go to the mines on Spring 11 or else you will be too far behind on metal collection.

### Other Notes

* Don't read any of your mail unless explicitly told to by the guide.
  * This is because at many points in the run, you need to stay at 0 gold for the purposes of staying out late. Since some letters contain gold, you want to only check the mail at specific points.
* When chopping down trees, pause the game during the tree falling animation. The tree 
* Choose Mushrooms over Bats for the Cave. This is for several reasons:
  * The cave restocks much faster, granting more total items.
  * On average, mushrooms sell for more than fruit.
  * Common Mushrooms are a good energy food. They have high GPE and you can build up a large stack of them.
* It is possible to get up to 22 Spring Onions on Spring 1.

## The Route

### Spring 1

* Chop 50 wood, make a Chest, place it next to the house. (Don't hoe anything yet.)
  * Only chop down Maple and Pine trees, not Oak trees. The only reason you should be chopping down an Oak tree is if it is directly blocking where your crops will go. (We will use them to farm as many Acorns as possible for later on in the run.)
  * Do not chop the stumps; only chop a tree until it falls, then move on to the next one. (It yields more wood and more foraging XP to do it this way.)
  * As soon as a tree starts to fall, walk towards where the wood will spawn and immediately pause the game. This prevents in-game time from passing, but the tree falling animation will still complete. Additionally, all of the wood will automatically be collected by the player while the game is still paused. (You should use this strategy whenever you are chopping trees and not bothering to kill the stumps.)
* Put everything in the chest except for Axe + Pickaxe + Scythe + Hoe.
* Head out the north end of your farm and go through the entire map, doing three things:
  1) Digging worms (artifact spots). Once you have one artifact, you can stop looking. If you get one, immediately donate it to the Museum for 250g.
  2) Getting all foragables.
  3) Shaking all Oak trees (for extra acorn drops, which should be saved until summer).
  4) Slashing every weed on the entire map (for the purposes of getting as many mixed seeds as possible). The two most important spots are to the left of the community center and above JoJaMart.
* After doing the loop around the forest, you should head back into town and make it back to Pierre's before he closes at around 4:30 PM.
* At Pierre's, sell all of the foragables, buy the maximum number of Parsnip seeds.
  * Do not bother saving any foragable for the community center; that can be done later on in the season.
* Go home, hoe + plant + water all Parsnips + mixed seeds.
* Chop 50 wood, make a Chest, and put it in storage.
* Kill all weeds on farm until 2 AM (for more mixed seeds), then pass out. (Do not go back to the Farmhouse and sleep.)
  * Time it such that you return to the crops and plant + water all of your renaming mixed seeds before 2 AM.
  * Note that you can work past 0 energy and become exhausted with no penalty carrying over to Spring 2 (because you will level up foraging). However, only do this at the end of the night, as the debuffed movement speed will make you kill less overall weeds.
* Do not ship any items today (since we want to stay at 0 gold).
* At the end of the day, you should get:
  * Foraging 0 --> 1

### Spring 2

* Read all of the mail (three letters in total). (We need to read Willy's letter in order to be given the Bamboo Pole.)
* Water.
* Ship:
  * all but 60 Fiber (for Scarecrows later on)
  * Clay
  * Geodes
* Empty all inventory in the first chest, take out the chest.
* Go to Bus Stop, grab foraging items if present. (Check behind the bus near the top.)
* Go to the beach and get the Bamboo Pole, grab foraging items if present.
* Go to the mountain lake fishing spot, place the chest one square to the left of the first wooden bridge.
* Fish until 2 AM, then pass out.
* At the end of the day, you should get:
  * Fishing 0 --> 3

### Spring 3

* (It always rains on this day.)
* Chop 50 wood, make a Chest. (Do not place it down yet.)
* Empty all inventory in the first chest except for Bamboo Pole + all fish.
* Retrieve the chest from the chest.
* Go to the beach. (Don't collect any beach foraging items until after you sell the fish.)
* Fish outside Willy's until 9 AM.
* Sell fish + buy Fiberglass Rod (1,800g) + 120 bait (5 x 120 = 600g).
  * If you do not have enough gold, then continue to fish outside of the Fish Shop until you have enough.
  * You only need about 80 bait if you go mining on day 5, but you will need more if you fish on day 5, which is why we get 120 to be safe.
* Go to the forest river fishing spot, place the chest next to you.
  * To make sure that you place the chest in a safe spot, you can reference the following pathing guide: https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/4/44/Pathing-Forest.jpg
* Fish until 2 AM, then pass out.

### Spring 4

* Water.
* Chop 50 wood, make a Chest, and put it in storage.
* Fish at the mountain lake until 2 AM, then pass out.

### Spring 5

* Move the TV next to the bed so that you can immediately check it upon waking up.
* From here on out, check the TV every single day to reveal the current day's luck.
* Harvest the Parsnips and make a note of how many you harvested.
* (Do not claim the reward for the parsnip quest, since we want to stay at 0 gold.)
* Water.
* Put all clay + Geodes + fish in the shipping bin.
* If a very unlucky day:
  * Fish at the mountain lake until 12:30 AM and then go home.
  * Put all fish in the shipping bin. (Since Willy does not work on Saturdays, we must sell them like this in order to have the necessary money for Kale. Otherwise, we would be able to fish until 2 AM.)
* Otherwise:
  * Retrieve the chest from the chest.
  * Go to the mines, place the chest to the right of the elevator.
  * Get as low as possible.
  * If it is near 2 AM and you know that you cannot reach the next elevator by the end of the night, then farm copper until 2 AM, then pass out.
  * (Even though we need as much money as possible on Spring 6, we do not have to leave the mines to because we can sell the gems to Clint tomorrow.)

### Spring 6

* Claim the reward for any outstanding quests from the journal.
* Check the mail.
* If you mined on Spring 5, make a furnace and smelt 5 Copper Bars (while doing other tasks). Keep the Copper Bars in your inventory.
  * Save all remaining copper for more Furnaces.
* If you missed a day of watering your Parsnips for whatever reason, harvest the rest of them now and make a note of how many you harvested.
* Pause the game and:
  * Calculate how much farming experience you currently have.
    * Parnips give 8 XP each.
  * Calculate how many Kale you would need to get farming level 6, which is 3300 total XP.
    * Kale gives 17 XP each.
    * e.g. ((3300 - current XP) / 17)
    * We need level 6 farming in order to get the Quality Sprinkler recipe. (The route will not work otherwise.)
  * Calculate how much gold you would need to buy that many Kale at 70g a seed.
* Start clearing + hoeing + watering 200 squares.
* At 8 PM, go into town from the Bus Stop.
* If you mined on Spring 5, go to Clint's, upgrade the Pickaxe and sell all gems.
* Go to Pierre's:
  * Sell low-quality Parsnips until you have enough money for the Kale Seeds.
  * Buy the Kale Seeds.
* Go home, make max Basic Fertilizer, fertilize + plant + water.
* (Don't sell anything to stay at 0 gold.)
* Mine/fish until 2 AM, then pass out. (Depending on the day's luck.)

### Spring 7-11

* (Don't sell anything to stay at 0 gold.)
* If you mined for the first time yesterday, make a furnace and smelt 5 Copper Bars (while doing other tasks). Keep the Copper Bars in your inventory.
  * At some point in the day, go into town and upgrade the Pickaxe.
  * Save all remaining copper on more Furnaces.
* Water.
* Upgrade pickaxe
* Mine/fish until 2 AM, then pass out.

### Spring 12

* Harvest.
* Ship everything. (We can't sell anything tomorrow at the fair.)
* Mine/fish until 2 AM, then pass out.

### Spring 13

* Claim the reward for any outstanding quests from the journal.
* Check the mail.
* Mine/fish until around 1 PM, then go to the festival. (The latest you can arrive to the town is 2 PM.)
* Buy max Strawberry Seeds (100g each).
* Clear the farm until 12 PM (to prepare for planting the Strawberry Seeds on day 16), then sleep.

### Spring 14

* Mine/fish until 2 AM, then pass out.

### Spring 15

* Salmonberries start spawning today, but do not venture too far out of your way to harvest them. (They are not worth a lot of extra time for the little energy that they return.)
* Mine/fish until 12:30 AM, then go home.
* Ship all extra items to get as much money as possible for the next day.

### Spring 16

* Hoe + plant + water all Stawberry Seeds.
* Go to Pierre's:
  * Buy the backpack upgrade (1,000g)
  * Buy max Kale Seeds
* Go home
* Hoe + fertilize + plant + water all Kale Seeds.
* At this point, you should have enough sprinklers to cover all your crops. If not, prioritize placing the sprinklers on the plots that are the farthest away from the pond (to minimize travelling back and forth with the watering can).
* Doing all of this should take all day.

### Spring 17

* Water (if not full sprinklers).
* Return to the mines to get any remaining materials needed for sprinklers.

### Spring 20-27

* From this point on you can do pretty much whatever you like for the rest of the season.
  * If you need extra money, fish at the forest river when it is raining for Catfish.

### Spring 22

* Buy + plant Kale. (If you plant it today, it will be ready to harvest on the 28th.)

## TTD

* track all day skillups
* fill in Spring ?
* test new fishing spots
* on day 4, you can fish straight downward at mountain lake, because you are level 5 fishing and you get the range increase at level 4 - At level 4 fishing and above, every downward cast should yield a gold fish (or irridium quality fish with a perfect catch).
* specify when level 8 fishing change to downward angle
* test to see if it is possible to get an acorn on day 1 from shaking
