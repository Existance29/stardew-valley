# Gold to Energy Ratios

* Given a choice between eating two different items, with all else equal, it is optimal to eat the one with the lower gold to energy ratio.
* A good rule of thumb is to:
  * save everything with a ratio equal to or less than 2 for eating
  * sell everything with a ratio above 2
* (S) indicates silver quality.
* (G) indicates gold quality.
* (I) indicates irridium quality.
